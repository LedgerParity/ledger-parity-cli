# Operator validation guide

This guide explains how a real Stellar payment operator can validate
LedgerParity against their own data. This is the final acceptance gate:
proof that the tool works on genuine operator exports, not just synthetic
fixtures.

## What the operator needs to provide

### 1. Sanitized application export

A JSON or CSV file containing your application's payment records. Each record
must include:

**Required fields (JSON array of objects or CSV with these headers):**

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| `id` | Unique record identifier (your internal ID) |
| `network` | Exact network passphrase (e.g., `"Test SDF Network ; September 2015"` or `"Public Global Stellar Network ; September 2015"`) |
| `operation_type` | Must be `"payment"` |
| `sender` | Sender's Stellar public key (starting with `G`) |
| `recipient` | Recipient's Stellar public key (starting with `G`) |
| `amount` | Positive decimal string (e.g., `"100.50"`) |
| `asset` | Asset code (e.g., `"XLM"`, `"USDC"`) |
| `asset_type` | `"native"` for XLM, `"credit_alphanum4"` or `"credit_alphanum12"` for tokens |
| `status` | `"completed"`, `"success"`, or `"settled"` (case-insensitive) |
| `timestamp` | RFC3339 timestamp (e.g., `"2026-09-01T12:00:00Z"`) |

**Optional fields:**

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| `asset_issuer` | Issuer public key for credit assets (required if `asset_type` is not `"native"`) |
| `operation_id` | Operation ID (recommended for disambiguation) |
| `reference_id` | Transaction hash (not memo) |
| `settlement_start` | Start of explicit settlement interval (RFC3339) |
| `settlement_end` | End of explicit settlement interval (RFC3339) |
| `business_reference` | Application-specific reference (separate from `reference_id`) |

**Example (JSON):**

```json
[
  {
    "id": "app-tx-001",
    "network": "Test SDF Network ; September 2015",
    "operation_type": "payment",
    "sender": "GABC...",
    "recipient": "GDEF...",
    "amount": "250.0000000",
    "asset": "USDC",
    "asset_type": "credit_alphanum4",
    "asset_issuer": "Gxxx...",
    "status": "completed",
    "timestamp": "2026-09-01T12:00:00Z"
  }
]
```

**Example (CSV):**

```csv
id,network,operation_type,sender,recipient,amount,asset,asset_type,asset_issuer,status,timestamp
app-tx-001,Test SDF Network ; September 2015,payment,GABC...,GDEF...,250.0000000,USDC,credit_alphanum4,Gxxx...,completed,2026-09-01T12:00:00Z
```

### 2. Configuration

Provide the time window and accounts to reconcile:

```json
{
  "target_app": {
    "name": "your-app-name",
    "format": "json",
    "source_path": "path/to/your-export.json",
    "complete": true
  },
  "stellar": {
    "network": "your-network-passphrase",
    "accounts": ["YOUR_SENDER_ACCOUNT_G..."]
  },
  "reconciliation": {
    "start": "2026-09-01T00:00:00Z",
    "end": "2026-09-02T00:00:00Z",
    "timeframe_tolerance_sec": 600
  }
}
```

### 3. Known discrepancy (optional but valuable)

If you already know of a specific discrepancy (e.g., a missed settlement,
incorrect amount, or duplicate record), note it separately. This helps verify
that LedgerParity catches real issues.

## How to run the validation

### Step 1: Export your data

Export your application's payment records for the agreed time window. Sanitize
any sensitive fields (customer names, memos, etc.) but preserve all
Stellar-relevant identity fields exactly.

### Step 2: Share the export

Send the export file and config to the LedgerParity maintainer. The export
should be a clean file with no application secrets, API keys, or customer PII.

### Step 3: Run reconciliation

The maintainer will run:

```sh
ledger-parity --config operator-config.json \
  --bundle operator-evidence.json --out operator-report.json
```

### Step 4: Review results

The report will show:
- **Matches**: payments found in both your export and on-chain
- **Discrepancies**: payments where amounts, assets, or identity differ
- **Unknowns**: payments that couldn't be verified (incomplete coverage,
  ambiguous candidates, etc.)

### Step 5: Verify a known discrepancy

If you noted a known discrepancy, confirm that LedgerParity identified it.
This is the key validation: the tool catches real issues, not just synthetic
ones.

## What this proves

- LedgerParity works on real operator data, not just test fixtures
- The reconciliation engine handles genuine export formats
- The tool correctly identifies matches, discrepancies, and unknowns
- The evidence bundle is reproducible and auditable

## Limitations

- This is read-only validation; LedgerParity never signs or moves funds
- Coverage trusts the operator's export completeness; it does not prove
  cryptographic history
- A single operator validation does not prove universal applicability
- The operator's export must be sanitized to remove PII before sharing

## Contact

To participate in operator validation, open a GitHub issue with the label
`operator-validation` or contact the maintainer directly. Provide:

1. Your role (payment operator, exchange, issuer, etc.)
2. Network (testnet or mainnet)
3. Approximate number of payments in the time window
4. Whether you have a known discrepancy to verify
